REQUIREMENTS

	1) EXISTING
		- All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
		- All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
		- At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
		- Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
		- The Quality of an item is never negative
		- "Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
		- The Quality of an item is never more than 50 (however "Sulfuras" is a
			legendary item and as such its Quality is 80 and it never alters.)
		- "Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
		- "Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
			Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
			Quality drops to 0 after the concert

	2) NEW FEATURE
		- "Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items
